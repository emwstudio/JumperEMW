"""The four locomotion tasks are each other's controls, and that has to hold.

They exist to be compared: same robot, same reward, same observations, same
curriculum shape, **one variable changed** -- the gait. A difference that is not
the gait makes every comparison between them mean something else, and it does so
silently, because each task on its own looks perfectly reasonable.

That has already happened twice. `jumper.tetrapod` declared no command ladder and
ran on a module default nobody chose for it. `jumper.ripple` and `jumper.flat` built
their ladders by clamping and appending to the shared *absolute* rungs, which
squeezed one to (0.625, 0.875, 1.0) of its own ceiling and stretched the other to
(0.312, 0.437, 0.625, 1.0) -- three different curricula wearing one name, so
"level 1" meant three different fractions of what each robot could do.

So this pins the parity rather than the values: whatever the numbers are, the four
have to agree on them unless the field is in one of the two exemptions below.

## Where a parameter belongs

    constants.py   facts about the hardware. One robot, one IMU, one set of
                   current sensors, one 2 kg chassis -- so one value, shared.
                   EFFORT_LIMIT, STAND_Z, the noise levels, PUSH_VELOCITY_RANGE.

    common/        mechanism, and no tuning. The reward functions, the curriculum
                   classes, the ladder's *shape*. A number here is a number four
                   tasks inherit without choosing.

    <task>/        every parameter. Even when all four agree -- especially then,
                   because agreement that is written down survives one of them
                   changing, and agreement that is a default does not.

Adding a fifth locomotion task means adding it to `TASKS` here, and
`test_every_jumper_task_is_accounted_for` is what makes that happen rather than
something to remember. `jumper.dance` is a jumper task and is deliberately **not** in
`TASKS`: it has no command, no gait prior and a different reward budget, so it is
not one of these tasks' controls and forcing parity on it would only mean the
comparison stops saying anything.
